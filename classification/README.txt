This project opens up car.txt and reads different parameters about the cars to predict the class of the car. 
The code uses a 3 layer nueral network in tensorflow to predict the 4 different car classes. 
I used Scikit learn to encode the data in the class from strings to intigers. 
I also used scikit learn to get aditional data about the performance fo the algorithm at the end of the training set such as recall and F1. 
Car.csv has the data in it, and the other files have additional information. 
There is another version of this using KNN in the other folder that uses SKlearn.
